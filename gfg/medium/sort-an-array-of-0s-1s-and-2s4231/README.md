## Problem

Given an array  **arr[]**  containing only 0s, 1s, and 2s **.**  Sort the array in ascending order. 

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: arr[] = [0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2]
Output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]
Explanation: 0s, 1s and 2s are segregated into ascending order.
```

```
Input: arr[] = [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1]
Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2]
Explanation: 0s, 1s and 2s are segregated into ascending order.
```

        for element in arr:
            if element==0:
                zero.append(element)
            if element==1:
                one.append(element)
            if element==2:
                two.append(element)
        result=zero+one+two
        arr[:]=result
        return arr
