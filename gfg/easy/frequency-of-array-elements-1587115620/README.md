# Frequencies in a Limited Array

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given an array  **arr[]**  containing positive integers. The elements in the array arr[] range from  1 to n (where n is the size of the array), and some numbers may be repeated or absent. Your have to count the frequency of all numbers in the range 1 to n and return an array of size n such that result[i] represents the frequency of the number **i**  (1-based indexing).

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: arr[] = [2, 3, 2, 3, 5]
Output: [0, 2, 2, 0, 1]
Explanation: We have: 1 occurring 0 times, 2 occurring 2 times, 3 occurring 2 times, 4 occurring 0 times, and 5 occurring 1 time.
```

```
Input: arr[] = [3, 3, 3, 3]
Output: [0, 0, 4, 0]
Explanation: We have: 1 occurring 0 times, 2 occurring 0 times, 3 occurring 4 times, and 4 occurring 0 times.
```

```
Input: arr[] = [1]
Output: [1]
Explanation: We have: 1 occurring 1 time, and there are no other numbers between 1 and the size of the array.
```

```py
class Solution:
    def frequencyCount(self, arr):
        freq={}
        for i in range(1,len(arr)+1):
            freq[i]=0
        for x in arr:
            if x in freq:
                freq[x]+=1
        return list(freq.values())
            

```
